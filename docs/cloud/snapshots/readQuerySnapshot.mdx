## Introduction

Retrieving multiple documents from a Firestore query typically involves processing a query snapshot. The `readQuerySnapshot` function streamlines this process by transforming a query snapshot into an easily manageable array of document data objects, each including the document ID.

### Key Features

- **Simplified Data Extraction**: Converts query snapshots into an array of data objects with document IDs.
- **Excludes Non-Existent Documents**: Automatically filters out documents that do not exist, ensuring data integrity.
- **Type Safety with Generics**: Supports generic typing for document data, enhancing type safety and reducing errors.

### Utilization

#### Preparing for Query Snapshot Reads

Import `readQuerySnapshot` to handle Firestore query snapshot processing:

```ts
import { firestore } from 'firebase-admin'
import { readQuerySnapshot } from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Assuming 'querySnapshot' is obtained from a Firestore query
const querySnapshot: firestore.QuerySnapshot = firestore()
  .collection('path/to/collection')
  .get()
```

#### Extracting Data Array from a Query Snapshot

Use `readQuerySnapshot` to process the query snapshot into an array of document data objects:

```ts
// Process the query snapshot
const documentsArray = readQuerySnapshot(querySnapshot)

// 'documentsArray' contains an array of objects, each with document data and ID
```

## Handling Empty or Non-Existent Documents

`readQuerySnapshot` ensures that only existing documents are included in the returned array, skipping any documents that are not found in the database.

## Best Practices

- Utilize `readQuerySnapshot` for batch data retrieval from Firestore to ensure consistent data handling.
- Leverage the generic typing feature to maintain type safety across your Firestore data processing.
- Always verify the returned array, especially in cases where the query might return no documents.

<Warning>
  Be mindful of Firestore's performance and rate limits when handling large
  query snapshots. Optimize your queries to fetch only necessary data.
