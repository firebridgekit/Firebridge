## Install the package

In order to use the cloud utils, you must install the `@firebridge/cloud` package. You must also have the firebase admin SDK installed.

```bash
yarn add @firebridge/cloud
# OR
npm install @firebridge/cloud
```

## Usage

You can browse the sidebar to see the different utilities available. Below are just a few ideas that will help you get started.

### Define Actions

In many cases, you will want to define some actions that can be performed on your database. You can use the `firestoreSet`, `firestoreUpdate`, and `firestoreDelete` utilities to create these actions. These might be stored in `@/actions/...`.

```ts
import { firestoreSet, firestoreUpdate } from '@firebridge/cloud'

type Profile = {
  name: string
  bio?: string
}

export const setProfile = firestoreSet<Profile>('profiles')
export const updateProfile = firestoreUpdate<Profile>('profiles')
export const deleteProfile = firestoreDelete('profiles')
```

### Create Callables

You can use the `callable` utility to define invokeable actions. These actions can be invoked from the client using the `invoke` utility. These could be stored in `@/callables/...`.

```ts
import { onCall, callable } from '@firebridge/cloud'

const onUpdateProfile = onCall<Profile>(
  callable({
    action: async ({ name, bio }, { auth }) => {
      // Check if bio is explicit
      const isExplicit = await checkIsExplicit(bio)
      if (isExplicit) throw new Error('bio is explicit.')

      await updateProfile(auth.uid, { name, bio })
    },
  }),
)
```
