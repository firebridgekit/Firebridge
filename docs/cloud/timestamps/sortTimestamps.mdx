## Introduction

Organizing and comparing time-based data often requires sorting timestamps. The `sortTimestamps` function provides a reliable and straightforward way to compare and sort Firestore timestamps, accommodating possibly missing values to ensure robust and error-free operations.

### Key Features

- **Chronological Sorting**: Compares two Firestore timestamps and sorts them chronologically.
- **Handles Missing Timestamps**: Gracefully manages scenarios where one or both timestamps may be missing (`null` or `undefined`).
- **Versatile Application**: Ideal for use in array sorting methods or when manually comparing timestamps.

### Utilization

#### Comparing Two Timestamps

Import `sortTimestamps` and use it as a comparator function when sorting timestamps:

```ts
import { firestore } from 'firebase-admin'
import { sortTimestamps } from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Example Firestore timestamps
const timestamp1: firestore.Timestamp = firestore.Timestamp.now()
const timestamp2: firestore.Timestamp = firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(
  new Date('2020-01-01'),
)

// Comparing two timestamps
const comparisonResult = sortTimestamps(timestamp1, timestamp2)

// 'comparisonResult' will be 1, -1, or 0, depending on the chronological order of the timestamps
```

## Handling Missing Timestamps

`sortTimestamps` is designed to deal with missing timestamps effectively, ensuring that arrays of timestamps are sorted correctly even when some values are missing.

## Best Practices

- Integrate `sortTimestamps` into array sorting operations when dealing with Firestore timestamp data.
- Use `sortTimestamps` for manual timestamp comparisons to maintain consistency and reliability in your time-based logic.
- Be cautious when sorting large arrays of timestamps and consider performance implications.

<Warning>
  When working with timestamps from various sources, consider potential
  inconsistencies due to time zone differences or clock synchronization issues.
