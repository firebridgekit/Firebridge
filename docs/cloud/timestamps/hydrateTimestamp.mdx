## Introduction

Handling timestamps in Firestore often involves serializing and deserializing them, especially when working with external systems or storing data in formats like JSON. `hydrateTimestamp` simplifies the process of converting serialized timestamps back into Firestore's native Timestamp format.

### Key Features

- **Restores Firestore Timestamps**: Converts serialized timestamp representations back into Firestore Timestamp objects.
- **Error Handling**: Validates the input and throws an error for invalid or missing serialized timestamps.
- **Flexible Input Support**: Accepts different serialized timestamp formats for conversion.

### Utilization

#### Converting Serialized Timestamps

Use `hydrateTimestamp` to convert a serialized timestamp into a Firestore Timestamp object:

```ts
import { hydrateTimestamp } from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Example of a serialized Firestore timestamp
const serializedTimestamp = { seconds: 1234567890 }

// Convert it back to a Firestore Timestamp
const timestamp = hydrateTimestamp(serializedTimestamp)
```

## Handling Invalid Timestamps

If the serialized timestamp is invalid or not provided, `hydrateTimestamp` throws an error, ensuring that only valid timestamps are processed.

## Best Practices

- Use `hydrateTimestamp` when dealing with serialized Firestore timestamp data to maintain data consistency and integrity.
- Always handle potential errors when converting serialized timestamps to avoid unexpected crashes or data issues.
- Be aware of the format of your serialized timestamps to ensure compatibility with `hydrateTimestamp`.

<Warning>
  Proper error handling is crucial when using `hydrateTimestamp` to prevent
  issues with invalid or missing timestamp data.
