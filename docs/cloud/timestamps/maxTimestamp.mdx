## Introduction

In applications where time tracking is crucial, such as logging events or updates, identifying the latest timestamp is a common requirement. The `maxTimestamp` function simplifies this task by evaluating an array of Firestore Timestamps and returning the most recent one.

### Key Features

- **Latest Timestamp Identification**: Extracts the most recent timestamp from an array of Firestore Timestamps.
- **Handles Missing Values**: Skips over `null` or `undefined` values to focus on valid timestamps.
- **Robust and Efficient**: Utilizes efficient sorting to determine the latest timestamp quickly.

### Utilization

#### Preparing Timestamps for Evaluation

```ts
Import `maxTimestamp` and use it to find the latest timestamp from an array:

typescript
import { firestore } from 'firebase-admin'
import { maxTimestamp } from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Example array of Firestore timestamps
const timestamps: PossiblyMissing<firestore.Timestamp>[] = [
  firestore.Timestamp.now(),
  null,
  firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(new Date('2020-01-01')),
  // More timestamps
]
```

#### Finding the Latest Timestamp

Invoke `maxTimestamp` with the array of timestamps to identify the most recent:

```ts
// Determine the latest timestamp
const latestTimestamp = maxTimestamp(timestamps)

// 'latestTimestamp' will be the most recent timestamp, or undefined if all values are missing or the array is empty
```

## Handling Arrays with Missing or No Timestamps

`maxTimestamp` is designed to return `undefined` when faced with an array that is either empty or contains only missing (null/undefined) timestamps, enabling seamless handling of such scenarios.

## Best Practices

- Use `maxTimestamp` when you need to determine the most recent event or data update timestamp in your application.
- Ensure that the array of timestamps is accurately populated to avoid incorrect evaluations.
- Consider the implications of time zones and clock skew when working with timestamps from different sources.

<Warning>
  Timestamp comparisons can be impacted by time zone differences and clock
  synchronization issues. Ensure that all timestamps are comparable and sourced
  reliably.
</Warning>
