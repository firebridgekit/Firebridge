## Introduction

Working with Firestore often involves managing timestamps. The `timestampToDate` function is designed to convert serialized Firestore timestamps, commonly used in data interchange and storage, back into JavaScript Date objects for easy manipulation and display in applications.

### Key Features

- **Seamless Conversion**: Transforms serialized Firestore timestamps into JavaScript Date objects.
- **Error Validation**: Checks for the presence and validity of the input timestamp, throwing an error for any inconsistencies.
- **Compatibility**: Adapts to different serialized timestamp formats for conversion.

### Utilization

#### Converting Serialized Timestamps to Dates

Use `timestampToDate` to convert a serialized Firestore timestamp into a JavaScript Date object:

```ts
import { timestampToDate } from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Example of a serialized Firestore timestamp
const serializedTimestamp = { seconds: 1234567890 }

// Convert it to a JavaScript Date object
const date = timestampToDate(serializedTimestamp)
```

## Handling Invalid Timestamps

`timestampToDate` ensures robust error handling by throwing an error for invalid or undefined serialized timestamps, safeguarding against improper conversions.

## Best Practices

- Utilize `timestampToDate` for converting Firestore timestamps when displaying dates in your application.
- Implement error handling around `timestampToDate` to gracefully manage potential conversion errors.
- Be mindful of the timestamp format in your data to ensure successful conversion.

<Warning>
  Accurate timestamp conversion is crucial for data integrity. Validate your
  serialized timestamps and handle conversion errors appropriately.
