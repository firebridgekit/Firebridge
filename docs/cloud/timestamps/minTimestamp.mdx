## Introduction

In various applications, particularly those involving time-based data analysis or event logging, pinpointing the earliest timestamp is a frequent necessity. The `minTimestamp` function streamlines this process by evaluating an array of Firestore Timestamps and returning the earliest one.

### Key Features

- **Earliest Timestamp Retrieval**: Determines the first timestamp from a given array of Firestore Timestamps.
- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: Directly sorts and retrieves the earliest timestamp, ensuring a quick and straightforward operation.
- **Handles Undefined Values**: Appropriately deals with arrays containing `undefined` or missing timestamps.

### Utilization

#### Preparing Timestamps for Evaluation

First, import `minTimestamp` and prepare an array of Firestore Timestamps:

```ts
import { firestore } from 'firebase-admin'
import { minTimestamp } from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Example array of Firestore timestamps
const timestamps: PossiblyMissing<firestore.Timestamp>[] = [
  firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(new Date('2020-01-01')),
  firestore.Timestamp.now(),
  // More timestamps
]
```

#### Finding the Earliest Timestamp

Use `minTimestamp` to identify the earliest timestamp from the array:

```ts
// Determine the earliest timestamp
const earliestTimestamp = minTimestamp(timestamps)

// 'earliestTimestamp' will be the earliest timestamp, or undefined if the array is empty
```

## Handling Arrays with Missing or No Timestamps

When provided with an array that is either empty or contains only missing (null/undefined) timestamps, `minTimestamp` returns `undefined`, allowing for clean handling of such cases.

## Best Practices

- Employ `minTimestamp` when you need to ascertain the first occurrence or the initiation of an event in your application.
- Verify that the array of timestamps is correctly populated to ensure accurate identification of the earliest timestamp.
- Be aware of potential discrepancies in timestamps due to time zone differences or inconsistent time settings across data sources.

<Warning>
  Time comparisons can be affected by variations in time zones and clock
  synchronization. Ensure consistency in your timestamp data to achieve reliable
  results.
