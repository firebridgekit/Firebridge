## Usage

You can use the `firestoreDelete` function to delete a document from a collection. The only required parameter is a function returning the `path` to the document you want to delete.

```ts
const deletePost = firestoreDelete('posts')

// Delete the document
const postId = 'post-id-1'
await deletePost(postId)
```

## Return Value

The return value of `firestoreDelete` is a function that returns a `Promise` that resolves to `void`.

## Recursion

When you delete a document, all subcollections are not automatically deleted. You can use the `firestoreDelete` function to delete a document and all of its subcollections.

```ts
// Recursively delete all subcollections
const deletePost = firestoreDelete('posts', { recursive: true })

const postId = 'post-id-1'
await deletePost(postId)
```

This can be useful if posts have comments and you want to delete all comments when a post is deleted.
