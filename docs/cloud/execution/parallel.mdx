## Introduction

Performing multiple Firestore operations sequentially can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of documents. `executeFirestoreParallel` addresses this challenge by executing operations in parallel, enhancing the efficiency of your Firestore interactions.

### Key Features

- **Concurrent Operations**: Executes Firestore operations simultaneously, rather than one after another.
- **Chunking for Performance**: Splits operations into manageable chunks to optimize performance and avoid overloading Firestore's limits.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: In case of a failure in any operation, the function rejects with an error, ensuring robust error handling.

### Utilization

#### Defining Firestore Operations

Prepare an array of `FirestoreOperation` objects, each specifying the operation type, target document reference, and necessary data:

```ts
import {
  FirestoreOperation,
  executeFirestoreParallel,
} from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Example Firestore operations
const operations: FirestoreOperation[] = [
  {
    type: 'set',
    ref: firestore().doc('path/to/doc1'),
    data: {
      /* your data */
    },
  },
  {
    type: 'update',
    ref: firestore().doc('path/to/doc2'),
    data: {
      /* your data */
    },
  },
  // Add more operations as needed
]
```

#### Executing Operations in Parallel

Invoke `executeFirestoreParallel` with the array of operations. Operations are automatically chunked for optimal performance:

```ts
// Execute operations in parallel
await executeFirestoreParallel(operations, 25) // 25 is the chunk size
```

## Handling Large Operation Sets

For handling a large number of operations, `executeFirestoreParallel` splits them into smaller groups (chunks) to maintain efficient performance and conform to Firestore's limitations.

## Best Practices

- Adjust the chunk size based on the complexity and number of operations to balance performance and resource usage.
- Ensure all operations are independent of each other to avoid conflicts during parallel execution.
- Implement comprehensive error handling to manage partial failures in operation sets.

<Warning>
  Parallel execution is powerful but should be used judiciously. Consider
  Firestore's rate limits and quotas to avoid potential issues with large-scale
  operations.
