## Introduction

Handling multiple operations on Firestore documents in a single atomic transaction can be challenging. The `executeFirestoreBatch` function simplifies this by batching operations, ensuring consistency and integrity of your Firestore data.

### Key Features

- **Atomic Transactions**: Executes a series of Firestore operations as a single atomic transaction.
- **Supports Multiple Operations**: Handles 'set', 'update', and 'merge' operations on Firestore documents.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures all operations in a batch either succeed together or fail without committing any changes.

### Utilization

#### Defining Firestore Operations

Create an array of `FirestoreOperation` objects, specifying the operation type, document reference, and data for each operation:

```ts
import {
  FirestoreOperation,
  executeFirestoreBatch,
} from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Example operations
const operations: FirestoreOperation[] = [
  {
    type: 'set',
    ref: firestore().doc('path/to/doc1'),
    data: {
      /* your data */
    },
  },
  {
    type: 'update',
    ref: firestore().doc('path/to/doc2'),
    data: {
      /* your data */
    },
  },
  // Add more operations as needed
]
```

#### Executing the Batch

Pass the array of operations to `executeFirestoreBatch` to perform them as an atomic transaction:

```ts
// Execute batch operations
await executeFirestoreBatch(operations)
```

## Handling Large Batches

For batches with more than 500 operations, `executeFirestoreBatch` automatically chunks them into smaller groups, adhering to Firestore's limitations on batch size.

## Best Practices

- Structure your data and operations to minimize the need for large transactions.
- Test your batch operations thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.
- Implement error handling to gracefully manage any issues during batch execution.

<Warning>
  While batching operations can be powerful, it's important to use this utility
  judiciously to maintain performance and avoid exceeding Firestore's
  operational limits.
