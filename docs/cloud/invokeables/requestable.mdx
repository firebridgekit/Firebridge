## Introduction

In the realm of serverless architectures, Firebase HTTPS triggers are pivotal for handling HTTP requests. The `requestable` utility enriches these triggers with additional layers of security, validation, and functionality, making your cloud functions more robust and reliable.

### Key Features

- API Key Validation: Ensures each request contains a valid `x-api-key`.
- Strong Typing: Safeguards `context.auth.uid` as a string for consistent authentication handling.
- Request Body Validation: Leverages schemas to validate incoming request data.
- Custom Action Invocation: Facilitates the execution of specified actions with validated inputs.

### Utilization

#### Setting Up HTTPS Triggers

`requestable` wraps around your core logic, enhancing it with pre-configured functionalities. Here's how to set it up:

```ts
import { requestable, onRequest } from 'path-to-your-utilities'

// Define your action
const yourAction = async (body, context) => {
  // Your logic here
}

// Set up your HTTPS trigger
export const yourHttpsTrigger = onRequest(
  requestable({
    action: yourAction,
    validation: {
      /* your validation schema */
    },
  }),
  {
    /* runtime modes */
  },
)
```

#### API Key Validation

Every incoming request is checked for an `x-api-key` header, ensuring only authenticated requests are processed.

```ts
// Inside your action
// The API key validation is automatically handled by `requestable`
```

#### Request Body Validation

Define a validation schema to ensure the request body meets your application's requirements.

```ts
// Define your validation schema
const yourValidationSchema = {
  /* your schema */
}

// Include it in the requestable setup
export const yourHttpsTrigger = onRequest(
  requestable({
    action: yourAction,
    validation: yourValidationSchema,
  }),
  {
    /* runtime modes */
  },
)
```

#### Custom Action Execution

Pass your business logic as an action to `requestable`, and it will be invoked with a validated body and context.

```ts
// Define your custom action
const yourAction = async (body, context) => {
  // Your business logic
}

// Include it in the requestable setup
export const yourHttpsTrigger = onRequest(
  requestable({
    action: yourAction,
    // ...other options
  }),
  {
    /* runtime modes */
  },
)
```

## Best Practices

- Regularly update your validation schemas to match your evolving data requirements.
- Monitor API key usage and implement rate limiting if necessary.
- Ensure all actions are well-tested to handle various request scenarios effectively.

<Warning>
  Pay special attention to the security aspects of your HTTPS triggers. Validate
  all inputs and handle API keys securely to prevent unauthorized access.
