description: 'The `useCollection` hook makes it simple to connect with realtime Firestore collections, even when paths are dynamic or depend on the ID of the current user. This hook is particularly useful in React applications where collection paths depend on runtime values like user IDs or route parameters.'

## Basic Usage

The simplest usage of `useCollection` is to provide a `CollectionReference` or `QueryReference` to the hook. This will fetch the documents and return their data. The hook will also automatically update the component with the latest data whenever a document changes.

First, let's connect to all of the books in our Firestore database:

<CodeGroup>

```ts Web
import { useCollection } from '@fiebridge/web'
import { collection, query, where } from 'firebase/firestore'

// Your local Firestore instance
import firestore from '@/services/firestore'

const books = useCollection<Book>(collection(firestore, 'books'))
```

```ts Native
import { useCollection } from '@firebridge/native'
import firestore from '@react-native-firebase/firestore'

const books = useCollection<Book>(firestore.collection('books'))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Dynamic Paths

It's very common in Firebase applications to include the user's ID inside a document. This makes it simple to write Firestore security rules that restrict access to documents based on the user's ID. However, this also means that we need to know the user's ID before we can fetch the document.

Instead of providing a function instead of a `CollectionReference` or `QueryReference` directly, we'll need to provide a function which can produce one. This function's first argument will be the user ID of the active user.

<CodeGroup>

```ts Web
const ownBooks = useCollection<Book>(uid =>
  query(collection(firestore, 'books'), where('authorId', '==', uid)),
)
```

```ts Native
const ownBooks = useCollection<Book>(uid =>
  firestore.collection('books').where('authorId', '==', uid),
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Custom Route Parameters

We can also include other string parameters in the document path, and ensure they exist before fetching the document. This is a common pattern in Firebase applications on React where document paths might depend on other dynamic values (e.g., route parameters). Firebridge makes it easy to manage these dependencies with a similar syntax to the `useEffect` hook.

For example, we might want to display a set of `Book` documents that share the same `authorId` as a the book we're currently displaying. In this case, the query we want to connect to depends on the book document.

<CodeGroup>

```ts Web
const BOOK_ID = 'some-book-id'
const book = useDocument<Book>(doc(firestore, 'books', BOOK_ID))
const authorId = book?.authorId

// Now, we'll pull in the books by the same author.
const booksByTheSameAuthor = useCollection<Book>(
  (_uid, a) =>
    query(collection(firestore, 'books'), where('authorId', '==', a)),
  [authorId],
)
```

```ts Native
const BOOK_ID = 'some-book-id'
const book = useDocument<Book>(firestore.collection('books').doc(BOOK_ID))
const authorId = book?.authorId

// Now, we'll pull in the books by the same author.
const booksByTheSameAuthor = useCollection<Book>(
  (_uid, a) => firestore.collection('books').where('authorId', '==', a),
  [authorId],
)
```

</CodeGroup>
