## Introduction

Interacting with Firebase Cloud Functions often requires a straightforward yet flexible approach, especially in React applications. The `useCallable` hook offers a convenient way to invoke cloud functions, complete with automatic logging and response handling.

### Key Features

- **Easy Cloud Function Invocation**: Facilitates calling Firebase Cloud Functions with minimal setup.
- **Automatic Logging**: Integrates logging for each function call, improving debugging and monitoring.
- **Type-Safe Requests and Responses**: Supports generic typing for request bodies and expected responses, enhancing type safety.

### Utilization

#### Setting Up a Callable Function

Import `useCallable` and create a callable function for your specific cloud function:

```ts
import { functions } from 'path-to-your-firebase-config'
import { useCallable } from 'path-to-your-hooks'

// Example: Creating a callable function for 'myFunction'
const myFunction = useCallable<{ input: string }, { result: string }>(
  functions,
  'myFunction',
)
```

#### Invoking the Cloud Function

Invoke the cloud function with the necessary request body and handle the response:

```ts
// Call 'myFunction' with a request body
const response = await myFunction({ input: 'Hello' })

// 'response' contains the data returned from the cloud function
```

## Handling Function Responses

The hook automatically handles the response from the cloud function, providing it in the expected format as specified in the generic types.

## Best Practices

- Utilize `useCallable` for all Firebase Cloud Function invocations to maintain consistency and ease of use across your application.
- Leverage the generic typing to ensure that request bodies and responses are handled correctly and predictably.
- Implement error handling around the cloud function invocation to manage any exceptions or unexpected responses.

<Warning>
  Be cautious with the data sent to and received from cloud functions,
  especially when dealing with sensitive or user-specific information.
