Firebridge is a set of patterns that will help you build powerful and consistent developer experiences with Firebase on React Web and Native.

- 🤌 Just the right amount of abstraction.
- ⚛️ Built natively with React hooks to manage state.
- 🕹️ Minimal boilerplate — take back full control where you need it.
- 🔌 Strong integration of TypeScript types for functions, data, and more.
- ☁️ Simplified server logic for Callables, batch execution, and more.
- 📱 High consistency between `react` and `react-native`.
- ✅ Reliance on well adopted libraries:
  - 🔥 [`react-firebase-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-firebase-hooks) for web.
  - ☄️ [`react-native-firebase`](https://rnfirebase.io/) for native.
